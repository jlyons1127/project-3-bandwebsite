          Big Time Rush is an American pop music boy band formed in 2009.
          Comprised of members Kendall Schmidt, James Maslow, Carlos PenaVega,
          and Logan Henderson, the band was created simultaneously with the
          Nickelodeon television series of the same name. The group released
          three studio albums, BTR (2010), Elevate (2011), and 24/seven (2013),
          before entering an indefinite hiatus in 2014. In the late 2010s, Big
          Time Rush purchased the rights to their name from Nickelodeon and Sony
          Music, and in 2021, they announced plans to reunite, releasing new
          music and resuming live performances. As of 2022 they started going on
          tour and released new music and even going on tour in South America
